Introducing Ola HWA.(Hackathon Winning App), which includes the best features which make Ola the best riding app in India.
The latest iteration of the ever-awesome Ola app includes features like,

##OlaWear

##OlaStats
Ever wondered how much you travel in Ola? Enough to ditch your own vehicle? Use OlaStats to find your riding spendings. Icing on the cake? Earn points for each kilometer you ride and the high-scorers get a prize per week!
##OlaJAM-Ride
Jam all the way to your destination by playing your pre-defined playlist in the ola cab’s speaker system!
##OlaUnite
Be a good samaritan and a environment lover by Car Pooling your cab. Share a ride with someone going the same way and reduce your carbon footprint. Did we mention you save some money too? Who says good karma is thankless?
##OlaCron
Use Ola daily at the same time and place? Schedule cabs to pick you up and have the cab waiting for you while you are ready to go.
##OlaShare
Splitting bills when at a restaurant? Why stop there? Share your cabs with friends and split the share within the ola app. They pay their share, you pay yours. Sharing is caring :)
